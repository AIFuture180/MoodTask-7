Deployment Instructions





Create a GitHub Repository:





Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g., moodtask).



Upload Files:





Clone the repository to your local machine.



Copy all files (index.html, blog.html, privacy.html, css/, js/, images/) into the repository.



Commit and push the files to GitHub.



Enable GitHub Pages:





Go to the repository's Settings on GitHub.



Scroll to the Pages section.



Set the Source to main (or your default branch) and the folder to / (root).



Save, and GitHub will provide a URL (e.g., https://username.github.io/moodtask).



Configure Email Signup:





Replace the formspree.io/f/placeholder URL in index.html with your own Formspree or Mailchimp form action URL.



Update Affiliate Links:





Replace placeholder Amazon affiliate links (e.g., https://amzn.to/3example) with your actual links.



Test the Site:





Visit the GitHub Pages URL to ensure the site loads correctly.



Test responsiveness on mobile and desktop devices.

Notes





Ensure all images are optimized (e.g., <100KB) and placed in the images/ folder.



Update the logo.png placeholder with your actual logo.



The site is accessible (ARIA landmarks, alt text) and SEO-optimized (meta tags, schema markup).



For audio assets, ensure the URLs in index.html (e.g., soundscape audio) are valid and hosted publicly.
